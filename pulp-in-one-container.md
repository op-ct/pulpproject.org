Installing Pulp 3 and getting all the services running can be challenging. To reduce the complexity of getting started with Pulp, the Pulp team created a single container image that has all necessary services to run Pulp 3.

The image is available under the `pulp` namespace on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/pulp/pulp/). This image includes the Ansible, Container, File, Maven, Python, and RPM plugins. A new version is published every time there is a plugin update available. You can update your environment to the latest version of the container using `docker pull`.

If you experience any problems, check the [Known Issues](/pulp-in-one-container/#known-issues) section for workarounds. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to us on `pulp-list@redhat.com` or the `#pulp` channel on Freenode IRC.  

You can use either `podman` or `docker`. If you use `docker`, substitute `docker` for `podman` in the following examples.

The following commands can be used to start Pulp 3.4.1 with `podman 1.8.0`, which is available on Fedora 31.

```
$ mkdir settings pulp_storage pgsql containers
$ echo "CONTENT_ORIGIN='http://$(hostname):8080'
ANSIBLE_API_HOSTNAME='http://$(hostname):8080'
ANSIBLE_CONTENT_HOSTNAME='http://$(hostname):8080/pulp/content'
TOKEN_AUTH_DISABLED=True" >> settings/settings.py
```

## With SELinux

For systems with SELinux in enforcing mode, use the following command to start Pulp:

```
$ podman run --detach \
             --publish 8080:80 \
             --name pulp \
             --volume ./settings:/etc/pulp:Z \
             --volume ./pulp_storage:/var/lib/pulp:Z \
             --volume ./pgsql:/var/lib/pgsql:Z \
             --volume ./containers:/var/lib/containers:Z \
             --device /dev/fuse \
             pulp/pulp
```

## Without SELinux

For systems without SELinux in enforcing mode, use the following command to start Pulp:

```
$ podman run --detach \
             --publish 8080:80 \
             --name pulp \
             --volume ./settings:/etc/pulp \
             --volume ./pulp_storage:/var/lib/pulp \
             --volume ./pgsql:/var/lib/pgsql \
             --volume ./containers:/var/lib/containers \
             --device /dev/fuse \
             pulp/pulp
```

In both cases, you will see the following output. The last line contains the container ID that you can use to execute commands inside the container.

```

Note that the container ID is unique to your deployment.

Use the container ID to reset the `admin` user's password. `podman` also accepts the first part
of the ID for convenience.

```
$ podman exec -it pulp bash -c 'pulpcore-manager reset-admin-password'
Please enter new password for user "admin":
Please enter new password for user "admin" again:
Successfully set password for "admin" user.
```

At this point, both the REST API and the content app are available on your host's port `8080`.

To start working with Pulp, check out the [Workflows and Use Cases](https://docs.pulpproject.org/workflows/index.html).
For individual plugin documentation, see [Pulp 3 Content Plugin Documentation](/docs/#pulp-3-content-plugin-documentation).

## References

The Container file and all other assets used to build the container image
are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/pulp/pulp-oci-images).

## Known Issues

Any known issues and workarounds are listed here.

### Docker on CentOS 7

While using the version of Docker that is provided with CentOS 7, there is a known issue that will cause the following error to occur:

`FATAL:  could not create lock file "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432.lock": No such file or directory`

The version of Docker that is provided with CentOS 7 mounts `tmpfs` on `/run`. The Pulp Container recipe uses `/var/run`, which is a symlink to `/run`, and expects its contents to be available at container run time. This lack of availability causes the quick fail.

You can work around this by specifying an additional `/run` volume, which suppresses this behavior of the Docker run time. Docker will copy the image's contents to that volume and the container should start as expected.

If executing `docker exec -it pulp bash -c 'pulpcore-manager reset-admin-password'` fails with an error like the following:

```
psycopg2.OperationalError: could not connect to server: No such file or directory
        Is the server running locally and accepting
        connections on Unix domain socket "/var/run/postgresql/.s.PGSQL.5432"?
```

It will be necessary to create a `postgresql` directory under the `/run` volume, with permissions that the container's postgresql can write to:

```console
$ mkdir -p settings pulp_storage pgsql containers run/postgresql
$ chmod a+w run/postgresql
```

### Upgrading from ``pulp/pulp-fedora31`` image

The ``pulp/pulp-fedora31`` container vendored PostgreSQL 11. The ``pulp/pulp`` image vendors PostgreSQL 12. Users wishing to migrate from PostgreSQL 11 to 12 should refer to [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/upgrading.html).
